This project demonstrates the following concepts:

.List operators: The scores list is created to store the student's test scores.

.Floor division: The  //  operator is used to calculate the average score.

.Comparison operators: The  =  and  <  operators are used to determine the grade based on the average score.

.Assignment operators: The  +=  operator is used to update the grade with a "+" if the average score's last digit is greater than or equal to 5.

.Membership operators: The in operator is used to check if a specific score exists in the list of scores.

.Identity operators: The is operator is used to compare if scores and scores_copy are the same object.

.Bitwise operators: The & operator is used to perform a bitwise AND operation on the first two scores.

Project Description:

The script calculates the student's average score using floor division, determines the grade using comparison operators, updates the grade using assignment operators, checks for score existence using membership operators, compares objects using identity operators, and performs bitwise operations on the scores.

- **Comparison operators** (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `==`etc.)
- **Assignment operators** (`+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- **Membership operators** (`in`, `not in`)
- **Identity operators** (`is`, `is not`)
- **Bitwise operators** (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, <<``>>`)
