Project: Student Record Management System Objective:

.Create a Python script that manages student records using tuples, sets, and frozen sets, and demonstrates various operations and methods.

Instructions:

1. Create tuples to store student information (name, age, grade).

2. Use tuple methods to count and index elements.

3. Create sets to store unique student IDs and courses.

4. Perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

5. Use frozen sets to create immutable sets of student data.

Concepts Demonstrated

.Tuples: Store student records as tuples, representing their name, age, and grade.

.Tuple Methods: Use len() to count the number of students and index() to find the index of a specific student.

Sets: Store unique student IDs and courses
Set Operations:

.update() adds new student IDs to the existing set - operator finds   remaining courses by subtracting completed courses from all courses.

.Frozen Sets: Create immutable sets of courses and student data. Attempting to modify a frozen set will raise an AttributeError.

Summary
This script demonstrates:
