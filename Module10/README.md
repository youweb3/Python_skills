#  Project 1

Project: Library Inventory Management
Objective:

Create a Python script that manages a library's inventory of books using lambdas, arrays, and simple OOP concepts.

Instructions:

1. Create a Book class with attributes for title, author, and availability.

2. Use an array to store the library's collection of books.

3. Implement methods to add books, search for books by title or author, and update book availability using lambdas.

4. Create instances of the Book class and test the functionality.


This project demonstrates the following concepts:

OOP: The Book and Library classes are defined to represent books and a library, respectively.
Arrays: The books attribute in the Library class is an array (list) that stores the library's collection of books.
Lambdas:
The search_by_title and search_by_author methods use lambdas to search for books based on title and author, respectively.
The update_availability method uses a lambda to update the availability of a book with a specific title.
The script creates instances of the Book class to represent individual books and an instance of the Library class to manage the library's inventory. It demonstrates adding books to the library, searching for books by title and author using lambdas, and updating book availability. Once you have your own example you can add this to your GitHub repo.
