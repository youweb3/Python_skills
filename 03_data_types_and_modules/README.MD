# 🧠 Python Data Types & Modules

### 📘 Overview
This folder contains Python mini-projects designed to practice **data types**, **type conversion**, and the use of **built-in modules** such as `random`, `math`, and `datetime`.  
Each project demonstrates a different concept related to how Python handles data and performs operations using imported modules.

## 📂 Project List

### 1️⃣ A_random_number_generator.py
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and demonstrates:
- The use of the `random` module  
- The `type()` function  
- Conversion between `int`, `float`, and `complex`  
- Multi-word variable naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)  
- String formatting with single and double quotes  

---

### 2️⃣ B_math_operations_with_module.py
Shows how to use the `math` module for numerical computations:
- Square roots, powers, rounding, and factorials  
- Demonstrates precision math using built-in functions  
- Includes clear comments and formatted output for readability  

---

### 3️⃣ C_datetime_example.py
Explores Python’s `datetime` module by:
- Getting and formatting the current date and time  
- Creating custom dates  
- Calculating time differences with `timedelta`  
- Adding and subtracting time intervals  

---

### 🧩 Key Concepts Learned
- Importing and using built-in Python modules  
- Understanding and converting between data types  
- Working with mathematical and temporal data  
- Writing clean, well-commented Python code

### 💡 Notes
Each file in this directory can be run independently.  
They collectively form the foundation for understanding how Python handles **data representation** and **module-based operations**.
